<p>Pentest Notes allows testers to keep track of what can be done, has been done, and still needs to be done during a network penetration test. To use Pentest Notes, create a new project using the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. Next, select the newly created project and import any Nessus or Nmap XML files into the project. The imported data will be organized by hosts and attacks. Select a host to get detailed information about it. Select an attack to get more details about the attack including the hosts that may be vulnerable to the attack. If you would like to make suggestions to improve the tool, submit code, or report issues please head over to <a href="https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/ptnotes">Github</a> and contribute.</p>
